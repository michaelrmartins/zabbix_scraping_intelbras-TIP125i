## Project Description

The project consists of a Python script that performs web scraping of the web page of an Intelbras IP phone model TIP 125i. The main objective is to extract relevant information from the web page for later use in a Zabbix template.

The script uses the Selenium library to interact with the web browser and collect data from the page. It is capable of extracting a variety of information, including device uptime, firmware version, IP address, MAC address, user account status, among others.

The use of web scraping allows automating the data collection process, making it more efficient and reliable. The collected information can be useful for remote monitoring of the device and detection of potential issues.

The project is configured to be used in conjunction with Zabbix, a network monitoring platform, allowing the collected data to be integrated into the existing monitoring system.

This project is useful for network administrators who want to monitor and maintain the Intelbras IP phone effectively and automatically. Detailed documentation is available in the README.md file of the GitHub repository, providing clear instructions on how to use the script and integrate the collected data into Zabbix.

The script is a valuable tool for simplifying the monitoring and maintenance process of IP telephony devices, contributing to more efficient management of the network infrastructure.
